# iOS-Weather-App
A very basic but still smexy weather app.

# Before you do anything...
This app requires a few things to set up before you're good to go.

First, make sure you have cocoapods installed.  If you don't, then click [here](https://cocoapods.org/) and follow their sorta-simple instructions (actually they're pretty straightforward).

Second—with Cocoapods installed—type `pod init` in the terminal in the WeatherApp directory, and add the following to your Podfile:
`pod 'Alamofire'`\
 `pod 'SwiftyJSON'`\
 `pod 'NVActivityIndicatorView'`\
 Then type `pod install`\\
Second, you'll need an API key in order to request weather data.  If you don't have one, then visit [the Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  Let me know if you have trouble figuring this out.

# And that's it.
Let me know if you're having any issues.  Enjoy
